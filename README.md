# Naruto Counter App

Welcome to the Naruto Counter app! As a devoted Naruto fan, I've created this application to combine my love for the series with the joy of counting.

## Introduction

I'm a huge Naruto enthusiast, and I thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in the world of shinobi and jutsu. With this app, not only can you keep track of counts, but you can also enhance your Naruto viewing experience. Why not grab a shot glass and take a sip every time Naruto says "Dattebayo" while watching the anime? It's a fun and lighthearted way to enjoy the series (but please be careful).

## Features

- Increment and Save Counts: Use the "+" button to increase the count, and save the count using the "Save Count" button. Keep track of any number you need with ease.
- Naruto Theme: Immerse yourself in the Naruto universe while using the app. The user interface is designed with elements inspired by the iconic anime series.
- Sound Effects: Get the full Naruto experience with interactive sound effects. When you save the count, you'll hear Naruto's signature catchphrase, "Dattebayo," adding a playful touch to the app.

## Technologies Used

The Naruto Counter app is built with the following technologies:

- HTML/CSS: The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, creating an immersive Naruto-themed experience.
- JavaScript: The counting functionality and sound effects are implemented using JavaScript, making the app interactive and dynamic.
